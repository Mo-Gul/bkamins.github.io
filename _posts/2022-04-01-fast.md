# Introduction

Several years ago I switched to Julia because of its speed. However, every day I
am positively surprised how fast it is.

Today I was writing a simulation where I needed to check if some value was
contained in some collection. Traditionally programmers are recommended to use
the `Set` structure to perform such operation. However, since I needed to
squeeze out every last bit of performance in my code I investigated all
available options. Julia developers positively surprised me as it seems that
they managed to implement an extremely fast lookup in a standard `Vector`
type.

Therefore in my post today I decided to share some benchmark results showing
how fast lookup in `Vector` container is against `Set` lookup.

The post was written under Julia 1.7.0, DataFrames.jl 1.3.2,
BenchmarkTools.jl 1.3.1, and Plots.jl 1.27.1.

# The experiment

In order to test scalability of lookup I decided to test the performance for
collections from size 10 to 40 to see if some trend can be observed. I wanted
to store in them random strings and then perform a check if every value stored
in the collection is indeed present in it.

To ensure fair evaluation of the results I used the `@belapsed` macro
from the BenchmarkTools.jl package. Here is the test code:

```
using DataFrames
using BenchmarkTools
using Random
using Plots

f(x, r) = all(in(x), r) # function testing lookup speed

df = DataFrame()
Random.seed!(1234)

for i in 10:40
    v = [randstring(rand(1:1000)) for _ in 1:i] # randomly generate a Vector
    s = Set(v) # turn it to Set for comparison
    @assert length(s) == i # make sure we had no duplicates
    t1 = @belapsed f($s, $v)
    t2 = @belapsed f($v, $v)
    # display the intermetiate results so that I can monitor the progress
    @show (i, t1, t2)
    push!(df, (;i, t1, t2))
end

plot(df.i, [df.t1 df.t2];
     labels=["Set" "Vector"],
     legend=:topleft,
     xlabel="collection size",
     ylabel="time in seconds")
```

The code produces the following plot:

In the plot it seems that performance of function `f` doing lookup for both
collections scales approximately linearly in the tested range. The lookup in
`Set` is slower than the lookup in `Vector`. Additionally, which is positive,
lookup time in `Vector` has a more stable timing (`Set` timings are strangely
jagged). Finally, it seems that the difference in the timing increases with
collection size. Let us visualize this:

```
plot(df.i, df.t1-df.t2;
     labels="Set-Vector",
     legend=:topleft,
     xlabel="collection size",
     ylabel="time difference in seconds")
```

Indeed it seems that the timing difference increased in the tested range of
collection sizes.

# Conclusions

It is getting late today, and I do not want to delay my weekly posts. Therefore,
I will do some more testing in the coming week and report you the results in my
next post.

From today's experiments we can see that in the test setting I used
`Vector` lookup was significantly faster than `Set` lookup.

As a side note, it was super easy to implement these benchmarks in Julia.
