# Introduction

Before I begin let me make a small announcement. In my [last post][lastpost] I
have advertised an introductory Julia course for data science that will start
next week at MIT. If someone is interested in the material we are going to
cover you can find it [here][git]. There is also an option to attend the course
remotely. The content will be streamed via MS Teams. If you would like to join
please register yourself [here][mst].

Now, back to the usual business. This week I have registered the
[TableMetadataTools.jl][tmt] package. It aims to make common operations
on table metadata more convenient.

Recently I have written about how one can work with metadata in
[this post][metapost]. Today, I want to give another example of working with
table metadata and discuss the major functionalities that
[TableMetadataTools.jl][tmt] offers. The key difference is that this time
we will use JSON source.

The post was written under Julia 1.8.5, DataFrames.jl 1.4.4, JSON3.jl 1.12.0,
TableMetadataTools.jl 0.1.0, and Parquet2.jl 0.2.5.

# The data

This time I chose the [Electric Vehicle Population Data][source] data to
analyze. This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through
Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).

We will want with the JSON file [rows.json][data] that can be downloaded from
that website, so before proceeding please download it to your working folder.
The analysis I present is done for the file that I downloaded on Jan 12, 2023.

In the post we will:

1. Read the JSON file and load both data and metadata contained in it into a
   data frame.
2. Perform some simple analysis of the data.
3. Save the data as Parquet file (since it supports metadata).

(note - some of the output in this post will be wide, so in some displays
it might not look very nice; however, it looks OK if you try it in the terminal
or Jupyter Notebook)

# Data ingest

First load the required packages:

```
julia> using DataFrames

julia> using JSON3

julia> using Parquet2

julia> using Statistics

julia> using TableMetadataTools
```

Next we read the JSON file to a dictionary-like structure:

```
julia> data_json = open(JSON3.read, "rows.json")
JSON3.Object{Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}, Vector{UInt64}} with 2 entries:  :meta => {…
  :data => JSON3.Array[Any["row-briu~kmbv-8jap", "00000000-0000-0000-6480-…
```

It is instructive to investigate the structure of this object, as it is complex:

```
julia> function traverse(obj; level=0)
           if level > 4 || !(obj isa AbstractDict)
               print(" ...")
               return
           end
           for key in keys(obj)
               print("\n", " " ^ level, key, ":")
               traverse(obj[key], level=level+2)
           end
       end
traverse (generic function with 2 methods)

julia> traverse(data_json)

meta:

```

As you can see we have descended only two levels in the hierarchy and already
there is a lot of information.

Actual data is stored in `:data` field. The rest is metadata,
of which interesting for us will be `:name`, `:description`, and `:columns`.

Before move forward, let us peek at `data_json.meta.view.columns` vector:

```
julia> data_json.meta.view.columns[[1; end]]
2-element Vector{JSON3.Object}:
 {
               "id": -1,
             "name": "sid",
     "dataTypeName": "meta_data",
        "fieldName": ":sid",
         "position": 0,
   "renderTypeName": "meta_data",
           "format": {},
            "flags": [
                       "hidden"
                     ]
}
 {
                    "id": 561974359,
                  "name": "WAOFM - GIS - Legislative District Boundary",
          "dataTypeName": "number",
           "description": "",
             "fieldName": ":@computed_region_8ddd_yn5v",
              "position": 21,
        "renderTypeName": "number",
         "tableColumnId": 87270518,
   "computationStrategy": {
                             "source_columns": [
                                                 "geocoded_column"
                                               ],
                                       "type": "georegion_match_on_point",
                                 "parameters": {
                                                       "region": "_8ddd-yn5v",
                                                  "primary_key": "_feature_id"
                                               }
                          },
                "format": {}
}
```
(I have displayed only first and last element of the vector contained in this
metadata entry as the rest are similar). This vector stores column-level
metadata. The interesting fields are `:name`, `:fieldName`, and `:description`
(the last is not always present).

Finally, let us investigate `data_json.data` object. Again, we pick only
the first and last element:

```
julia> data_json.data[[1; end]]
2-element Vector{JSON3.Array}:
 Any["row-briu~kmbv-8jap", "00000000-0000-0000-6480-436D376BD73A", 0,
 1670541195, nothing, 1670541238, nothing, "{ }", "JTMEB3FV6N",
 "Monroe"  …  "42", "0", nothing, "198968248",
 "POINT (-81.80023 24.5545)", nothing, "12087972100", "51", nothing, nothing]
 Any["row-acyi~zx2n-aq3x", "00000000-0000-0000-BA64-2573B5CAA8F7", 0,
 1670541195, nothing, 1670541258, nothing, "{ }", "YV4BR0CL8N",
 "King"  …  "18", "0", "47", "194673692",
 "POINT (-122.09124 47.33778)", "PUGET SOUND ENERGY INC||CITY OF TACOMA - (WA)",
 "53033032005", "3009", "8", "46"]
```

We see that the data is stored in rows.

# Loading data to a data frame

Having this knowledge let us load the data into a data frame.

First we extract the column-level metadata into a data frame for convenience:

```
julia> data_colmeta = DataFrame(name=getproperty.(cols, :fieldName),
                                label=getproperty.(cols, :name),
                                note=get.(cols, :description, nothing))
28×3 DataFrame
 Row │ name                         label                              note

```

We now, in a structured way, see that the metadata contains: column name,
column descriptive label, and, optionally, note about column contents.

Assume that from all the available columns we want to keep only few most
interesting. The `DATA_COLSKEEP` vector keeps column numbers we want to store
in a data frame.

```
julia> const DATA_COLSKEEP = [9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19];

julia> keepat!(data_colmeta, DATA_COLSKEEP)
7×3 DataFrame
 Row │ name            label                              note
     │ String          String                             Union…

   7 │ electric_range  Electric Range                     Describes how far a vehicle can …
```

Now we are ready to create a data frame with our data. First create its schema
and populate the metadata:

```
julia> data_df = DataFrame(data_colmeta.name .=> Ref(String[]))
0×7 DataFrame
 Row │ vin_1_10  state   model_year  make    ev_type  cafv_type  electric_range
     │ String    String  String      String  String   String     String
─────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

julia> caption!(data_df, data_json.meta.view.name);

julia> note!(data_df, data_json.meta.view.description);

julia> for row in eachrow(data_colmeta)
           label!(data_df, row.name, row.label)
           note!(data_df, row.name, row.note)
       end
```

Let us check if indeed metadata got properly stored. We can either extract
dictionaries:

```
julia> metadata(data_df)
Dict{String, String} with 2 entries:
  "note"    => "This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)."
  "caption" => "Electric Vehicle Population Data"

julia> colmetadata(data_df)
Dict{Symbol, Dict{String, String}} with 7 entries:
  :ev_type        => Dict("label"=>"Electric Vehicle Type", "note"=>"This distinguishes the vehicle as all electric or a plug-in hybrid.")
  :make           => Dict("label"=>"Make", "note"=>"The manufacturer of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).")
  :cafv_type      => Dict("label"=>"Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility", "note"=>"This categorizes vehicle as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles (CAFVs) based on the fuel requirement and electric-o…
  :state          => Dict("label"=>"State", "note"=>"The state in which the registered owner resides.")
  :vin_1_10       => Dict("label"=>"VIN (1-10)", "note"=>"The 1st 10 characters of each vehicle's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).")
  :electric_range => Dict("label"=>"Electric Range", "note"=>"Describes how far a vehicle can travel purely on its electric charge.")
  :model_year     => Dict("label"=>"Model Year", "note"=>"The model year of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).")
```

Or get a TOML representation of metadata (the first entry of TOML output means
that we did not store metadata style information):

```
julia> println(meta2toml(data_df, style=false))
style = false

[colmetadata.cafv_type]
label = "Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility"
note = "This categorizes vehicle as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles (CAFVs) based on the fuel requirement and electric-only range requirement in House Bill 2042 as passed in the 2019 legislative session."

[colmetadata.electric_range]
label = "Electric Range"
note = "Describes how far a vehicle can travel purely on its electric charge."

[colmetadata.ev_type]
label = "Electric Vehicle Type"
note = "This distinguishes the vehicle as all electric or a plug-in hybrid."

[colmetadata.make]
label = "Make"
note = "The manufacturer of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)."

[colmetadata.model_year]
label = "Model Year"
note = "The model year of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)."

[colmetadata.state]
label = "State"
note = "The state in which the registered owner resides."

[colmetadata.vin_1_10]
label = "VIN (1-10)"
note = "The 1st 10 characters of each vehicle's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)."

[metadata]
caption = "Electric Vehicle Population Data"
note = "This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)."
```

All looks good so far.

Additionally you can easily extract all column labels using the `labels` function:

```
julia> labels(data_df)
7-element Vector{String}:
 "VIN (1-10)"
 "State"
 "Model Year"
 "Make"
 "Electric Vehicle Type"
 "Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility"
 "Electric Range"
```

Now we store the data in our data frame:

```
julia> foreach(row -> push!(data_df, row[DATA_COLSKEEP]), data_json.data)

julia> show(data_df, truncate=10)

```

We are almost done. It looks like `:model_year` and `:electric_range` are
integer, so we perform an appropriate conversion:

```
julia> transform!(data_df,
                  [:model_year, :electric_range] .=> ByRow(x -> parse(Int, x)),
                  renamecols=false);
```

Here one important comment has to be made. Since we keep the old column names
for the transformed columns their `"label"` and `"note"` metadata is kept.
The reason is that this metadata originally had `:note` style. Let us check
that indeed metadata is kept:

```
julia> colmetadata(data_df, :model_year)
Dict{String, String} with 2 entries:
  "label" => "Model Year"
  "note"  => "The model year of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)."

julia> colmetadata(data_df, :electric_range)
Dict{String, String} with 2 entries:
  "label" => "Electric Range"
  "note"  => "Describes how far a vehicle can travel purely on its electric charge."
```

It is an important rule when working with `:note`-style metadata to keep old
column name only if we do not change the meaning of the column (like in our
case, where we just parsed it).

# Doing some analysis of the data

Let us check how many observations we have for combination of `:ev_type`
and `:cafv_type` columns:

```
julia> data_gdf = groupby(data_df, [:ev_type, :cafv_type], sort=true)

julia> data_agg1 = combine(data_gdf, nrow, :electric_range .=> extrema)
5×4 DataFrame
 Row │ ev_type                            cafv_type                          nrow   electric_range_extrema
     │ String                             String                             Int64  Tuple{Int64, Int64}
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │ Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)     Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle E…  46799  (39, 337)
   2 │ Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)     Eligibility unknown as battery r…  39236  (0, 0)
   3 │ Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)     Not eligible due to low battery …      9  (29, 29)
   4 │ Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle …  Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle E…  11840  (30, 153)
   5 │ Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle …  Not eligible due to low battery …  14750  (6, 29)
```

The results seem interesting, but we most likely cannot immediately understand
them. Let us check the column metadata:

```
julia> colmetadata(data_agg1)
Dict{Symbol, Dict{String, String}} with 2 entries:
  :ev_type   => Dict("label"=>"Electric Vehicle Type", "note"=>"This distinguishes the vehicle as all electric or a plug-in hybrid.")
  :cafv_type => Dict("label"=>"Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility", "note"=>"This categorizes vehicle as Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles (CAFVs) based on the fuel requirement and electric-only r…
```

We can see that only `:ev_type` and `:cafv_type` columns have metadata. This is
intended. These columns were not transformed so their metadata is kept because
it had `:note` style. On the other hand the `:electric_range` column was
transformed, by taking its extrema so its metadata was not propagated.

Now we can more easily understand the results. The `:ev_type` column tells us
if the vehicle is electric only or hybrid. On the other hand `:cafv_type`
column tells us if the vehicle meets the requirements of Clean Alternative
Fuel Vehicles.

Interestingly, for some BEV cars it is not known if they meet CAFV condition,
and this is indicated by `0` in their `:electric_range`. For other cases we see
that `30` is a minimal range that allows to classify vehicle as meeting CAFV.
Surprisingly six BEV do not meet it, as their battery range is too low.

Let us check how does the frequency of electric range equal to `0` behaves:

```
julia> data_agg2 = sort(unstack(data_df,
                                :model_year,
                                :ev_type,
                                :electric_range,
                                combine = x -> mean(x .> 0)))

```

We see that indeed the newest BEV do not have the range data (because it was not
collected yet). Also we learn that hybrids were introduced only in year 2011.

As above we can check that column metadata is only kept for `:model_year` column
since we did not transform it:
```
julia> colmetadata(data_agg2)
Dict{Symbol, Dict{String, String}} with 1 entry:
  :model_year => Dict("label"=>"Model Year", "note"=>"The model year of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).")
```

# Saving the data frame while keeping metadata

The `meta2toml` function was designed to allow for easy saving of metadata
to an independent file. However, I find it more convenient to save metadata
along with data. Here Parquet2.jl comes handy.

Let us work with `data_agg2` data frame:

```
julia> Parquet2.writefile("data_agg2.parquet", data_agg2)
✏ Parquet2.FileWriter{IOStream}(data_agg2.parquet)

julia> data_pq = Parquet2.Dataset("data_agg2.parquet")
≔ Parquet2.Dataset (928 bytes)
        1. "model_year": Int64
        2. "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)": Union{Missing, Float64}
        3. "Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)": Union{Missing, Float64}


julia> data_pq_df = DataFrame(data_pq);
```

We can check that both `data_pq` and `data_pq_df` have metadata information:

```
julia> println(meta2toml(data_pq))
style = true

[colmetadata."Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)"]

[colmetadata."Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)"]

[colmetadata.model_year]
label = ["Model Year", "default"]
note = ["The model year of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).", "default"]

[metadata]
caption = ["Electric Vehicle Population Data", "default"]
note = ["This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).", "default"]

julia> println(meta2toml(data_pq_df))
style = true

[colmetadata.model_year]
label = ["Model Year", "default"]
note = ["The model year of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).", "default"]

[metadata]
caption = ["Electric Vehicle Population Data", "default"]
note = ["This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).", "default"]
```

We note that the metadata has `:default` style, because Parquet does not
support metadata styles. Therefore, if we wanted to turn all metadata to `:note`
style, so that it would be propagated we can write e.g.:

```
julia> setallmetadatastyle!(data_pq_df);

julia> print(meta2toml(data_pq_df))
style = true

[colmetadata.model_year]
label = ["Model Year", "note"]
note = ["The model year of the vehicle, determined by decoding the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).", "note"]

[metadata]
caption = ["Electric Vehicle Population Data", "note"]
note = ["This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).", "note"]
```

# What features does TableMetadataTolls.jl provide?

Here is the list of functionalities that you can find in
[TableMetadataTools.jl][tmt] that are added on top of standard metadata
management functions defined in DataAPI.jl:

* the `label`, `label!`, `labels`, and `findlabels` functions for
  convenient work with column label metadata;
* the `caption` and `caption!` functions for convenient work with
  table caption metadata;
* `note` and `note!` functions for convenient work with note metadata both
  on table and column level;
* `unit` (re-exported from Unitful.jl), `unit!`, and `units` functions for
  convenient work with column unit metadata;
* `setmetadatastyle!`, `setcolmetadatastyle!`, `setallmetadatastyle!` for group
  setting style for keys matching a passed pattern; usually needed when working
  with metadata that initially has `:default` style set and one wants it to have
  `:note` style (common when reading metadata from storage formats that do not
  support metadata style information);
* `meta2toml` and `toml2meta!` for storing and loading metadata in TOML format;
* `dict2metadata!`, `dict2colmetadata!` for setting table and column level
  metadata stored in a dictionary (e.g. earlier retrieved from some storage
  format or by using metadata or colmetadata functions);
* the `@track` macro for tracking operations applied to table and the `tracklog`
  function for convenient printing of tracking metadata.

# Conclusions

I hope you will find this post useful as a tutorial to both working with
metadata and ingesting data from a complex JSON file into a data frame.

My general feeling is that, while metadata is commonly used by Stata or SAS
users, it had less adoption in other ecosystems. The reason is likely that
there was no decent support for storing and working with tabular metadata.
Now, I hope the combination of DataFrames.jl + Parquet2.jl helps to solve
this issue.

Admittedly in many cases you do not need table metadata. However, I am convinced
that if you work with tables that have hundreds or thousands of columns or that
you want to share your tables between teams having proper metadata attached
to data is essential.
