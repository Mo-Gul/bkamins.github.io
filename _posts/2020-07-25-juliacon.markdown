This year [JuliaCon][juliacon] is fully on line and for free!

I am co-authoring two talks during this event.

Let me start with one that is not directly DataFrames.jl related, but I think it
is a nice showcase of situations where Julia shines. It is prepared with
[Przemysław Szufel][pszufe], where Przemysław shows how one can build a large
scale simulation of transportation networks using Julia. You can find the
details [here][graphs].

The second talk is a tutorial is about DataFrames.jl indexing and you can find
more information about it [here][https://live.juliacon.org/talk/8SFYHK]. In
particular the materials that I will cover during this talk are available for
download on GitHub [here][dfrepo].

Finally, if you interested in data management related ecosystem in Julia, make
sure to join [Julia & Data: An Evolving Ecosystem][bof] that is organized by
[Jacob Quinn][qj] for a discussion about its current state and future
directions.
