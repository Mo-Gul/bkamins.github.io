# Introduction

In [DataFrames.jl][df] we have recently added in [this PR][notequal] a new
option for `matchmissing` keyword argument in joins. This functionality will be
made available in 1.2 release. In this post I want to discuss this new feature
before we release it.

The post is tested under Julia 1.6.1 and on DataFrames.jl `main` branch
(that includes the relevant [PR][notequal]).

# How `matchmissing` keyword argument works

The `matchmissing` keyword argument allows the user to decide how `missing`
value is handled in `on` columns in joins. After [this PR][notequal] you have
three options to choose from:
* `:error` (the default): throw an error if `missing` value is present in any of
  the `on` columns; the rationale is that `missing` indicates unknown value so
  if we knew it it could match to any of the non-missing values in the `on`
  columns in the other data frame we join;
* `:equal`: `missing` values are allowed and they are matched to `missing` values
  only; in this scenario we treat `missing` as any other value without giving
  it a special treatment;
* `:notequal` (a new option): in this case `missing` is considered to be not
  equal to any other value (including `missing`).

Let me comment a bit more on the consequences of the `:notequal` rule. In
`innerjoin` this means that rows with `missing` values will be dropped both in
left and right table. In `leftjoin`, `semijoin` and `antijoin` they are dropped
from the right table only (which means that if `missing` is present in the left
table it is retained in processing but considered not to match any row in right
table). Similarly in `rightjon` rows with `missing` are dropped from left table
only. The case that is most difficult to handle is `outerjoin`. The reason is
that if `missing` would be present in both left and right table they would be
considered not equal and produce separate rows in the output table. We
considered this behavior as potentially confusing and therefore decided not to
allow `:notequal` in `outerjoin`.

Let me move to the examples showing the `matchmissing=:notequal` at work.

# Examples

Here is a simple example code showing how the new option works:

```
julia> using DataFrames

julia> df1 = DataFrame(id=[1, missing, 3, 4], x=1:4)
4×2 DataFrame
 Row │ id       x
     │ Int64?   Int64
─────┼────────────────
   1 │       1      1
   2 │ missing      2
   3 │       3      3
   4 │       4      4

julia> df2 = DataFrame(id=[1, 2, missing, 4], y=1:4)
4×2 DataFrame
 Row │ id       y
     │ Int64?   Int64
─────┼────────────────
   1 │       1      1
   2 │       2      2
   3 │ missing      3
   4 │       4      4
```

Now we investigate all the possible join operations:

```
julia> innerjoin(df1, df2, on=:id, matchmissing=:notequal)
2×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id      x      y
     │ Int64?  Int64  Int64
─────┼──────────────────────
   1 │      1      1      1
   2 │      4      4      4
```

As you can see for `innerjoin` only rows with `:id` equal to `1` and `4` were
retained. Let us move forward:

```
julia> leftjoin(df1, df2, on=:id, matchmissing=:notequal, source=:source)
4×4 DataFrame
 Row │ id       x      y        source
     │ Int64?   Int64  Int64?   String
─────┼────────────────────────────────────
   1 │       1      1        1  both
   2 │       4      4        4  both
   3 │ missing      2  missing  left_only
   4 │       3      3  missing  left_only

julia> rightjoin(df1, df2, on=:id, matchmissing=:notequal, source=:source)
4×4 DataFrame
 Row │ id       x        y      source
     │ Int64?   Int64?   Int64  String
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────
   1 │       1        1      1  both
   2 │       4        4      4  both
   3 │       2  missing      2  right_only
   4 │ missing  missing      3  right_only
```

For `leftjoin` and `rightjoin` we retain `missing` but only in the table for
which all rows must be retained. Therefore in `leftjoin` for `:id` equal to
`missing` we have `:x` equal to `2`, but `:y` equal to `missing` (signaling that
there was no match which we can also see in `:source` column). The same
happens for `:id` equal to `missing` in `rightjoin`, but then `:x` is set to
`missing`.

The same rules work with `semijoin` and `antijoin` as you can see here:

```
julia> semijoin(df1, df2, on=:id, matchmissing=:notequal)
2×2 DataFrame
 Row │ id      x
     │ Int64?  Int64
─────┼───────────────
   1 │      1      1
   2 │      4      4

julia> antijoin(df1, df2, on=:id, matchmissing=:notequal)
2×2 DataFrame
 Row │ id       x
     │ Int64?   Int64
─────┼────────────────
   1 │ missing      2
   2 │       3      3
```

Finally `outerjoin` just throws an error:
```
julia> outerjoin(df1, df2, on=:id, matchmissing=:notequal)
ERROR: ArgumentError: matchmissing == :notequal for `outerjoin` is not allowed
```

# Conclusions

I hope this post helped you to learn the rationale and design of the new option
for the `matchmissing` keyword argument in joins. If you have any comments on
the functionality or its documentation please open an issue on [DataFrames.jl]
[df] GitHub repository.

Finally I would like to thank [pstorozenko][ps], [nilshg][nh], and
[nalimilan][nl] for working on this functionality.
