This time my post is going to be shorter than usual (but hopefully as exciting :)).

I am going to give a tutorial on [DataFrames.jl][df] during
[ODSC Europe 2021][odsc] conference.

You can find the link to the outline of my workshop
"DataFrames.jl: a Perfect Sidekick for Your Next Data Science Project"
[here][ab].

The materials that are going to be presented during the tutorial can be found in
[this GitHub repository][repo]. This is a first workshop where I decided not to
use Jupyter Notebook, but just classic Julia REPL so I hope participants will
also get convinced by it. Personally, I prefer using Julia REPL and plain old
text editor combo in all my work over any other currently available option.

Finally, I have written a small pre-conference post, that was published on ODSC
blog [here][blog]. It was meant to attract the attention of people who do not
use Julia yet. And to be clear: the benchmarks shown there were not something I
spent days to hand pick a favorable scenario for DataFrames.jl. It was the first
thing that came to my mind to check. Actually, initially I did not even consider
benchmarking against [Polars][pl] as it is not that popular yet. However, later
I wanted to check for myself how it compares. And indeed Polars turns out to
have a really decent implementation.

I hope you will find the shared materials useful!
