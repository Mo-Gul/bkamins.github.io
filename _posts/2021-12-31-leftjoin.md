# Introduction

This post continues the presentation of new features added in [DataFrames.jl]
[df] 1.3. This time I will discuss the `leftjoin!` function.

The post was written under Julia 1.7.0 and DataFrames.jl 1.3.1.
For performance comparison I have used R 4.1.2 and data.table 0.14.2.
Both in R and Julia I run the computations on 4 threads.

# An in place left join

Before release 1.3, DataFrames.jl already offered a rich set of efficient
join functions:
`innerjoin`, `leftjoin`, `rightjoin`, `outerjoin`, `semijoin`, `antijoin`,
and `crossjoin`.

However, they all have a common limitation: their result is a freshly allocated
data frame.

A common usage scenario in practice is that we would like to add some
new columns to an existing table in-place. This is more efficient and uses less
memory (which is relevant if we work with very large data frames).

Since DataFrames.jl 1.3 this option is available with the addition of the
`leftjoin!` function. if you run `leftjoin!(df1, df2; on=...)` then the contract
is that the `df1` data frame is updated in-place with columns coming from `df2`
based on matching rows of both data frames using the columns passed in the `on`
keyword argument.

It is important to remember that the design of `leftjoin!` assumes that the
columns of `df1` are left unchanged (this is crucial for performance of the
operation). However, this implies that each row in `df1` must have at most one
match in `df2`. Otherwise, `leftjoin!` would not be able to execute the
operation in-place since new rows would need to be added to df1. If you have
matching duplicate rows in `df2` then just use `leftjoin`.

Here are two minimal examples of `leftjoin!`.

# Performance benchmarks

Now let me run two performance benchmarks of DataFrames.jl against `data.table`.
In the benchmarks I use 32-bit integers to ensure comparability of memory
footprint of objects between R and Julia.

The first test is on sorted key column. We start with Julia:

```
julia> df1 = DataFrame(a=Int32.(1:10^8));

julia> df2 = DataFrame(a=Int32.(1:10^8), x = true);

julia> @time leftjoin!(df1, df2, on=:a);
  2.867632 seconds (221.45 k allocations: 2.433 GiB, 6.47% gc time, 3.98% compilation time)

julia> df1 = DataFrame(a=Int32.(1:10^8));

julia> @time leftjoin!(df1, df2, on=:a);
  2.934633 seconds (150 allocations: 2.421 GiB, 8.19% gc time)
```

And now the `data.table`:

```
> library(data.table)
> df1 = data.table(a=1:10^8)
> df2 = data.table(a=1:10^8, x=TRUE)
> system.time(df1[df2, on = 'a', x := i.x])
   user  system elapsed
  8.067   1.106   5.679
> df1 = data.table(a=1:10^8)
> system.time(df1[df2, on = 'a', x := i.x])
   user  system elapsed
  9.305   1.184   6.652
```

As you can see for sorted data DataFrames.jl timings are competitive. Let us
now check shuffled data.

We start with DataFrames.jl:

```
julia> df1 = DataFrame(a=shuffle!(Int32.(1:10^8)));

julia> df2 = DataFrame(a=shuffle!(Int32.(1:10^8)), x = true);

julia> @time leftjoin!(df1, df2, on=:a);
 23.881552 seconds (175 allocations: 3.167 GiB, 1.43% gc time)

julia> df1 = DataFrame(a=Int32.(1:10^8));

julia> @time leftjoin!(df1, df2, on=:a);
 18.909113 seconds (175 allocations: 3.167 GiB, 1.40% gc time)
```

and now the timing for `data.table`:

```
> df1 = data.table(a=sample(1:10^8))
> df2 = data.table(a=sample(1:10^8), x=TRUE)
> system.time(df1[df2, on = 'a', x := i.x])
   user  system elapsed
 30.778   1.791  23.153
> df1 = data.table(a=sample(1:10^8))
> system.time(df1[df2, on = 'a', x := i.x])
   user  system elapsed
 30.586   1.695  22.893
```

Again the timing of DataFrames.jl is competitive.

(let me stress here that this is just one set of examples and relative
performance of different packages can vary depending on the data and the
operating environment; the point of these tests is to show that currently
DataFrmes.jl is not much worse than `data.table` in execution of joins, as this
was a performance bottleneck of DataFrames.jl in the past)

# Conclusions

This time in the post I have focused on a single function: the `leftjoin!`.
The reason is that I believe that addition of an in-place left join to
DataFrames.jl is quite significant since it is needed in many data processing
scenarios, especially when working with large tables.
