# Introduction

Some time ago I wrote [a post][post] about my thoughts on copying of data when working with it in Julia.

Today I want to focus on a related, but more narrow topic related to DataFrames.jl.
People starting to work with this package are sometimes confused when columns
get copied and when they are not copied. I want to discuss the most common cases in this post.

Spoiler! The post is a bit long. If you want simple advice - you can skip to the section with conclusions.

The post was written using Julia 1.9.2 and DataFrames.jl 1.6.1.

# Getting a column from a data frame

Let us start with a simpler case. When does copying happen if we get a column form a data frame?

First we set up some initial data:

```
julia> using DataFrames

julia> df = DataFrame(a=1:10^6)
1000000×1 DataFrame
     Row │ a
         │ Int64
─────────┼─────────
       1 │       1
       2 │       2
       3 │       3
       4 │       4
       5 │       5
    ⋮    │    ⋮
  999997 │  999997
  999998 │  999998
  999999 │  999999
 1000000 │ 1000000
999991 rows omitted
```

There are three ways to get the `:a` column from this data frame: `df.a`, `df[:, :a]` and `df[!, :a]`.
Let us check them one by one. Start with `df.a`:

```
julia> df.a
1000000-element Vector{Int64}:
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       6
       7
       ⋮
  999995
  999996
  999997
  999998
  999999
 1000000

julia> @allocated df.a
0
```

`df.a` extracts the column without copying data. You can see it by the fact that there are no allocations performed in this operation.

Now check `df[:, :a]`, which uses a standard row index `:` that is also used in arrays:

```
julia> df[:, :a]
1000000-element Vector{Int64}:
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       6
       7
       ⋮
  999995
  999996
  999997
  999998
  999999
 1000000

julia> @allocated df[:, :a]
8000048
```

`df[:, :a]` copies data, we see a lot of memory allocated this time. This is an identical behavior to how `:` works for arrays.

Finally check `df[!, :a]`, which uses a non-standard `!` row index:

```
julia> df[!, :a]
1000000-element Vector{Int64}:
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       6
       7
       ⋮
  999995
  999996
  999997
  999998
  999999
 1000000

julia> @allocated df[!, :a]
0
```

We can see that `df[!, :a]` does not allocate. It is equivalent to `df.a`, just with a bit different syntax
(the indexing syntax with `!` is handy if we wanted to select multiple columns from a data frame, which is not possible with `df.a` syntax).

This part was relatively easy. Now let us turn to a harder case of setting a column of a data frame.

# Case 1: setting a column in a data frame using assignment

First store the `:a` column in a temporary variable `a` (without copying it):

```
julia> a = df.a
1000000-element Vector{Int64}:
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       6
       7
       ⋮
  999995
  999996
  999997
  999998
  999999
 1000000
```

Now let us check various options of creation of a column that will store `a`.
Begin with creating of a new column.

```
julia> df.b = a
1000000-element Vector{Int64}:
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       6
       7
       ⋮
  999995
  999996
  999997
  999998
  999999
 1000000

julia> df.b === a
true
```

We can see that if we put `df.b` on the left hand side the operation does not copy the passed data.
You probably already can guess that the same happens with `df[!, :c]` on left hand side. Indeed
it is the case:

```
julia> df[!, :c] = a
1000000-element Vector{Int64}:
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       6
       7
       ⋮
  999995
  999996
  999997
  999998
  999999
 1000000

julia> df.c === a
true
```

What about `df[:, :d]`? Let us see:

```
julia> df[:, :d] = a
1000000-element Vector{Int64}:
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       6
       7
       ⋮
  999995
  999996
  999997
  999998
  999999
 1000000

julia> df.d === a
false
```

So we see a first difference. When creating a new column the data was copied.
But what would happen if some column already existed in a data frame?

Well for `df.b` and `df[!, :c]` syntaxes nothing would change, as they just put
a right hand side vector into a data frame without copying it.
But for `df[:, :d]` the situation is different. Let us check:

```
julia> d = df.d;

julia> df[:, :d] = a;

julia> df.d === a
false

julia> df.d === d
true
```

We can see that if we use the `df[:, :d]` syntax on left hand side the operation is in-place,
that is the vector already present in `df` is reused and the data is stored in a column
already present in a data frame. This means that we cannot use `df[:, :d] = ...` to change
element type of column `:d`. Let us see:

```
julia> df[:, :d] = a .+ 0.5;
ERROR: InexactError: Int64(1.5)
```

Indeed `a .+ 0.5` contains floating point values, and the `:d` column allowed only integers.
Note that with `df.b = ...` or `df[!, :c] = ...` we would not have this issue as they
replace columns with what is passed on a right hand side:

```
julia> df.b = a .+ 0.5
1000000-element Vector{Float64}:
      1.5
      2.5
      3.5
      4.5
      5.5
      6.5
      7.5
      ⋮
 999995.5
 999996.5
 999997.5
 999998.5
 999999.5
      1.0000005e6
```

There is one more twist to this story. It is related to ranges.
The issue is that `DataFrame` object always materializes ranges
stored in it.
Therefore the following operation allocates data:

```
julia> df.b = 1:10^6
1:1000000

julia> df.b
1000000-element Vector{Int64}:
       1
       2
       3
       4
       5
       6
       7
       ⋮
  999995
  999996
  999997
  999998
  999999
 1000000
```

The issue is that generally `df.b = ...` does not allocate, but since we disallow storing
ranges as columns of a data frame (in our case the `1:10^6` range) the allocation still takes place.
You would have the same behavior with `df[!, :c] = 1:10^6`.

# Case 2: setting a column in a data frame using broadcasted assignment

Julia is famous for its powerful broadcasting capabilities. Let us thus investigate what happens when we
replace `=` with `.=` in our experiments. We will reproduce all the examples we gave above from scratch.

Start with `df.b .= a`:

```
julia> df = DataFrame(a=1:10^6);

julia> a = df.a;

julia> df.b .= a;

julia> df.b === a
false
```

We now see a difference. The `:b` column is freshly allocated.

Let us check the two other options of creation of a new column:

```
julia> df[!, :c] .= a;

julia> df.c === a
false

julia> df[:, :d] .= a;

julia> df.d === a
false
```

They have the same effect: a new column gets allocated.

In the case of an existing column `df.b .= ...` and `df[!, :c] .= ...`
would again create a new copied column:

```
julia> df.b .= a .+ 0.5
1000000-element Vector{Float64}:
      1.5
      2.5
      3.5
      4.5
      5.5
      6.5
      7.5
      ⋮
 999995.5
 999996.5
 999997.5
 999998.5
 999999.5
      1.0000005e6
```

The difference is with `df[:, :d] .= ...`:

```
julia> d = df.d;

julia> df[:, :d] .= a;

julia> df.d === a
false

julia> df.d === d
true

julia> df[:, :d] .= a .+ 0.5
ERROR: InexactError: Int64(1.5)
```

So we see that we have here an in-place operation just like with `df[:, :d] = ...`.

# Conclusions

As a summary let me discuss a common anti-pattern:

```
df.a = df.b
```

Given the examples I presented we know that after this operation the `:a` and `:b` columns
of the `df` data frame are aliased, i.e. `df.a === df.b` produces `true`. Usually this is not
a desired situation as many operations assume that columns of a data frame do not share memory.

Fortunately, we also already learned an easy fix to the aliasing problem. You can just write:

```
df.a .= df.b
```

To get a copy of `:b` stored in column `:a`.

I hope the examples I gave in my post today will be useful for your work with DataFrames.jl.
