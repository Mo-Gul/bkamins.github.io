# Introduction

Recently David Amos started posting interesting puzzles on Twitter. One of them
can be found [here][tweet] and asks to find the smallest number of knights that
you need to place on a chess board so that every square is either occupied by a
knight or attacked by a knight.

It looks as an interesting combinatorial problem. However, if one is in a rush
(e.g. I am usually quite busy with fixing bugs DataFrames.jl :)),
one wants to find a solution without having to write a lot of code and
implementing complex algorithms.

We notice that the posed problem is from optimization domain, so using
[JuMP.jl][jump] to solve it immediately comes to ones mind.
Let us give it a shot!

In the post I use Julia 1.8.1, Cbc.jl 1.0.1, and JuMP.jl v1.3.1.

# Solution

In the solution I will use 1 to 8 coordinates for both dimensions of the board
(the original Tweet asked for standard chess coordinates, like e.g. `b3` or `e5`,
but they will not be needed in the solution so I skip this requirement).

First let us load the packages we need:
```
julia> using Cbc

julia> using JuMP
```

Next, as required in the Tweet, we define the `attacked_by` function. It takes
horizontal and vertical coordinate of a square and returns a vector of cells by
which a given cell is attacked via a knight move:

```
julia> attacked_by(i, j) =
           [(p, q) for p in 1:8, q in 1:8
            if abs((p - i) * (q - j)) == 2]
attacked_by (generic function with 1 method)
```

In the definition we use the fact that the only possibility that the absolute
value of the product of two integers is equal to 2 is that one of them must have
absolute value equal to 1 and other absolute value equal to 2.

(If you think that the function does not have an optimal performance I agree
with you, but performance does not matter as the problem we have is small.)

Let us check if it works correctly:

```
julia> attacked_by(1, 1)
2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}:
 (3, 2)
 (2, 3)

julia> attacked_by(2, 2)
4-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}:
 (4, 1)
 (4, 3)
 (1, 4)
 (3, 4)

julia> attacked_by(4, 4)
8-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}:
 (3, 2)
 (5, 2)
 (2, 3)
 (6, 3)
 (2, 5)
 (6, 5)
 (3, 6)
 (5, 6)
```

It seems all is good.

Now the fun stuff begins. First define our optimization problem:

```
julia> model = Model(Cbc.Optimizer)
A JuMP Model
Feasibility problem with:
Variables: 0

CachingOptimizer state: EMPTY_OPTIMIZER

julia> model
A JuMP Model
Minimization problem with:
Variables: 64
Objective function type: AffExpr
`AffExpr`-in-`MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}`: 64 constraints
`VariableRef`-in-`MathOptInterface.ZeroOne`: 64 constraints
Model mode: AUTOMATIC
CachingOptimizer state: EMPTY_OPTIMIZER
Solver name: COIN Branch-and-Cut (Cbc)
Names registered in the model: c, x
```

As the variable in the model we set a matrix called `x`, which will hold `1`
in cells where a knight is placed and `0` in cells where no knight is placed.
As an objective we set that we want to minimize the number of used knights.
Finally we add 64 constraints saying that all cells must be attacked or covered
at least once.

We are ready for the final blow:

```

Result - Optimal solution found

Objective value:                12.00000000
Enumerated nodes:               0
Total iterations:               0
Time (CPU seconds):             0.10
Time (Wallclock seconds):       0.10

Total time (CPU seconds):       0.11   (Wallclock seconds):       0.11
```

Bang! We are done. We get a lot of output. It looks like the solver found
the optimal solution to the problem that has value 12, so we need at least 12
knights. The report that we see indicates that the problem was relatively easy
to solve.

We know that we need 12 knights, but where to put them? Let us check:

```
julia> Bool.(value.(x))
8×8 BitMatrix:
 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
 0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0
 0  1  1  0  1  1  0  0
 0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0
 0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0
 0  0  1  1  0  1  1  0
 0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0
 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
```

The optimal solution forms a nice symmetric pattern.

# Conclusions

Removing line breaks, that I added to make the code better fit the screen, our
solution has 6 lines (plus 3 lines for lading packages and printing the result).

JuMP.jl is amazingly expressive and easy to use. At the same time notice how
nicely it prints the elements of the optimization model (this is best
appreciated in the terminal in our case as the generated expressions are long).
If you never used it I recommend you check it out.

I can't wait for next challenges from David Amos.
