# Introduction

Before I start let me comment that exactly one year ago this blog has been
started. I hope to keep posting weekly updates on the Julia language, and
especially its ecosystem for data science, so:

Now let us go back to business.

The 1.1 release of the [DataFrames.jl][df] package introduced a small fix of how
the `subset` function works. Today I will discuss its design and compare it
to the `filter` function.


In this post I am using Julia 1.6.1 and DataFrames.jl 1.1.0.

# The design of `filter`

The `filter` function is defined in Julia Base. Therefore in DataFrames.jl we
add methods to it. Let us start with the contract for `filter(f, a)` then:

> Return a copy of collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`.
> The function `f` is passed one argument.

How do we translate this into DataFrames.jl realm? We have to cases.

If `a` is an `AbstractDataFrame` then we treat it as a collection of rows.
Therefore `f` will get one row of data and we expect it to return a `Bool` value.
As a result of the operation we produce a `DataFrame` (unless `view` keyword
argument is `true` in which case we return a `SubDataFrame`).

Here is a basic example:
```
julia> using DataFrames

julia> df = DataFrame(a=1:3)
3×1 DataFrame
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     1
   2 │     2
   3 │     3

julia> filter(row -> row.a != 2, df)
2×1 DataFrame
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     1
   2 │     3
```

A more efficient (faster to execute) way to express the same is:
```
julia> filter(:a => !=(2), df)
2×1 DataFrame
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     1
   2 │     3
```

As you can see the style is that you pass a `Pair` or column name and a
predicate function (i.e. a function that produces `Bool`). This has two
benefits. Firstly, the operation is type stable (thus faster). Secondly, in the
`row -> row.a != 2` we define a new anonymous function with each call of
`filter`, which causes compilation (unless the operation is wrapped in a
function or we predefine the predicate function).


The second case is when `a` is a `GroupedDataFrame`. In this case `f` will get
one group and should return a `Bool` value again. The result will be a
`GroupedDataFrame` with groups appropriately removed:

```
julia> gdf = groupby(df, :a)
GroupedDataFrame with 3 groups based on key: a
First Group (1 row): a = 1
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     1
⋮
Last Group (1 row): a = 3
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     3

julia> filter(sdf -> sdf.a != [2], gdf)
GroupedDataFrame with 2 groups based on key: a
First Group (1 row): a = 1
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     1
⋮
Last Group (1 row): a = 3
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     3
```

A `Pair` version is also supported:
```
julia> filter(:a => !=([2]), gdf)
GroupedDataFrame with 2 groups based on key: a
First Group (1 row): a = 1
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     1
⋮
Last Group (1 row): a = 3
 Row │ a
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     3
```

A crucial thing to note is that this time the predicate gets a data frame (or
its column/columns).

In summary --- the `filter` function (apart from the `view` keyword argument and
a special `Pair` syntax that improves the performance) works exactly like
the Julia Base contract requires.

Before we move forward you might notice that the `Pair` syntax for the
`AbstractDataFrame` case is different than the same syntax for `select`,
`transform`, and `combine` functions, where always a whole column is passed.
Indeed there is a small inconsistency. It was left for user convenience
and consistency with Julia Base.

On the other hand `subset` is fully consistent with the rest of DataFrames.jl
ecosystem, so let us move to it now.

# The design of `subset`

The `subset` function is designed for filtering of rows in a way consistent
with the `select`, `transform`, and `combine` functions. The contract for
the `subset(df, args...)` function is:

> Return a copy of data frame `df` containing only rows for which all values
> produced by transformation(s) `args` for a given row are `true`.

If instead of a `df` data frame you pass a `GroupedDataFrame` the rules are
the same, but the difference is that they apply to the `parent` of the
`GroupedDataFrame`. So this leads us to a list of differences from `filter`, as
in `subset`:
* the `AbstactDataFrame`/`GroupedDataFrame` argument goes first;
* you are allowed do pass multiple conditions on which you want to perform row selection;
* always works on whole columns;
* always filters rows;
* the transformation is expected to return a vector (not a scalar `Bool` --- remember
  we are filtering rows so the length of the vector must match the number of rows);
* by default always produces a data frame.

The additional differences follow the available keyword arguments:
* all transformations must produce vectors containing `true` or `false`; however,
  optionally `missing` is allowed if `skipmissing=true` (this option is not available in `filter`);
* for `GroupedDataFrame` case  if `ungroup=false` the resulting data frame is
  re-grouped based on the same grouping columns as the source `GroupedDataFrame`
  (but by default a data frame is returned).

The `view` keyword argument works like in `filter` and allows you to produce
a `SubDataFrame` instead of a `DataFrame`.

Enough theory, let us get to the examples:

```
julia> df2 = DataFrame(a=repeat(1:3, 2), b=1:6)
6×2 DataFrame
 Row │ a      b
     │ Int64  Int64
─────┼──────────────
   1 │     1      1
   2 │     2      2
   3 │     3      3
   4 │     1      4
   5 │     2      5
   6 │     3      6

julia> subset(df2, :a => ByRow(==(1)), :b => ByRow(isodd))
1×2 DataFrame
 Row │ a      b
     │ Int64  Int64
─────┼──────────────
   1 │     1      1
```

Here you can see that we had to wrap predicates in `ByRow` to make sure
that a vector of `Bool` is produce by the filtering conditions. Otherwise
you would get an error:
```
julia> subset(df2, :a => ==(1))
ERROR: ArgumentError: functions passed to `subset` must return an AbstractVector.
```

(By the way: this is a thing that was changed in DataFrames.jl 1.1 release;
previously unintentionally returning scalar `Bool` was allowed which was error
prone, as the comparison was made against a whole vector --- not its elements.)

The second key thing to remember is that `subset` filters rows always,
also in `GroupedDataFrame` case:

```
julia> gdf2 = groupby(df2, :a)
GroupedDataFrame with 3 groups based on key: a
First Group (2 rows): a = 1
 Row │ a      b
     │ Int64  Int64
─────┼──────────────
   1 │     1      1
   2 │     1      4
⋮
Last Group (2 rows): a = 3
 Row │ a      b
     │ Int64  Int64
─────┼──────────────
   1 │     3      3
   2 │     3      6

julia> subset(gdf2, :b => (x -> x .== maximum(x)))
3×2 DataFrame
 Row │ a      b
     │ Int64  Int64
─────┼──────────────
   1 │     1      4
   2 │     2      5
   3 │     3      6
```

This is often very useful if we want to filter rows by some within-group condition,
like in the example above.

Finally, let me show the `skipmissing` keyword argument at work:

```
julia> df3 = DataFrame(a=[1, missing, 3, 4])
4×1 DataFrame
 Row │ a
     │ Int64?
─────┼─────────
   1 │       1
   2 │ missing
   3 │       3
   4 │       4

julia> subset(df3, :a => ByRow(isodd))
ERROR: ArgumentError: missing was returned in condition number 1 but only true or false are allowed; pass skipmissing=true to skip missing values

julia> subset(df3, :a => ByRow(isodd), skipmissing=true)
2×1 DataFrame
 Row │ a
     │ Int64?
─────┼────────
   1 │      1
   2 │      3
```

# Conclusions

In summary both `filter` and `subset` are useful, but in
different contexts. The basic rules are:
* if you have multiple conditions to apply use `subset`;
* if you want to easily handle `missing` values use `subset`;
* if you have a single predicate that takes a single row (or a scalar)
  and returns `Bool` and want to filter a data frame use `filter`
  (this saves you typing `ByRow` in `subset`);
* if you have a single predicate that returns `Bool` and want to filter
  whole groups of a `GroupedDataFrame` (as opposed to rows) use `filter`.

The things are unfortunately a bit complex, but we provide them for user
convenience as both `filter` and `subset` are useful in different contexts.

Before I finish let me highlight that there are also in-place `filter!` and
`subset!` variants of these functions.
