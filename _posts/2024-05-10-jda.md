# Introduction

This week I got a nice little surprise in my office. A year after my [Julia for Data Analysis][jda]
book has been published I got a package with a set of printed versions of its Korean translation
[데이터 분석을 위한 줄리아][jda2]. It was really a nice experience and I hope that Julia users from Korea will like it.

Therefore, for today, I decided to discuss a functionality that is little known, but often quite useful.
It is related to adding conditional columns to a data frame.

The post was written under Julia 1.10.1, DataFrames.jl 1.6.1, and DataFramesMeta.jl 0.15.2.

# The problem

Assume you have the following data frame:

```
julia> using DataFrames

julia> df = DataFrame(x=-2.0:0.5:2.0)
9×1 DataFrame
 Row │ x
     │ Float64
─────┼─────────
   1 │    -2.0
   2 │    -1.5
   3 │    -1.0
   4 │    -0.5
   5 │     0.0
   6 │     0.5
   7 │     1.0
   8 │     1.5
   9 │     2.0
```

Now we want to add a second column to this data frame that contains a square root of column `"x"`.

A basic approach fails:

```
julia> df.sqrtx = sqrt.(df.x)
ERROR: DomainError with -2.0:
sqrt was called with a negative real argument but will only return a complex result if called with a complex argument. Try sqrt(Complex(x)).
```

The reason is that we cannot normally take a square root of a negative number.

We can perform a conditional processing for example like this:

```
julia> df.sqrtx = (x -> x < 0.0 ? missing : sqrt(x)).(df.x)
9-element Vector{Union{Missing, Float64}}:
  missing
  missing
  missing
  missing
 0.0
 0.7071067811865476
 1.0
 1.224744871391589
 1.4142135623730951

julia> df
9×2 DataFrame
 Row │ x        sqrtx
     │ Float64  Float64?
─────┼─────────────────────────
   1 │    -2.0  missing
   2 │    -1.5  missing
   3 │    -1.0  missing
   4 │    -0.5  missing
   5 │     0.0        0.0
   6 │     0.5        0.707107
   7 │     1.0        1.0
   8 │     1.5        1.22474
   9 │     2.0        1.41421
```

but I do not find this approach very readable (especially from the perspective of a beginner).

The alternative that I prefer is to work with a view of the source data frame. Let us first create such a view that contains all columns of the original data frame, but only rows in which column `"x"` is non-negative:

```
julia> dfv = filter(:x => >=(0.0), df, view=true)
5×2 SubDataFrame
 Row │ x        sqrtx
     │ Float64  Float64?
─────┼───────────────────
   1 │     0.0  0.0
   2 │     0.5  0.707107
   3 │     1.0  1.0
   4 │     1.5  1.22474
   5 │     2.0  1.41421
```

Now, we can add a column to such a view by using a plain `sqrt` function without any decorations:

```
julia> dfv.sqrtx2 = sqrt.(dfv.x)
5-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0
 0.7071067811865476
 1.0
 1.224744871391589
 1.4142135623730951

julia> dfv
5×3 SubDataFrame
 Row │ x        sqrtx     sqrtx2
     │ Float64  Float64?  Float64?
─────┼─────────────────────────────
   1 │     0.0  0.0       0.0
   2 │     0.5  0.707107  0.707107
   3 │     1.0  1.0       1.0
   4 │     1.5  1.22474   1.22474
   5 │     2.0  1.41421   1.41421

julia> df
9×3 DataFrame
 Row │ x        sqrtx           sqrtx2
     │ Float64  Float64?        Float64?
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │    -2.0  missing         missing
   2 │    -1.5  missing         missing
   3 │    -1.0  missing         missing
   4 │    -0.5  missing         missing
   5 │     0.0        0.0             0.0
   6 │     0.5        0.707107        0.707107
   7 │     1.0        1.0             1.0
   8 │     1.5        1.22474         1.22474
   9 │     2.0        1.41421         1.41421
```

Note that both `dfv` and `df` are updated as expected. The filtered-out rows get `missing` values.

It is important to highlight that this functionality works if the view (`SubDataFrame`) was created using all columns of the source data frame (like is done in the case of our `filter` call above).
The reason for this restriction is that if view contained some subset of columns the operation of adding a column would be unsafe (there would be a risk of accidental and unwanted overwrite of a column present in the source data frame that was not included in the view).

This functionality is especially nice in combination with DataFramesMeta.jl, just have a look:

```
julia> @chain df begin
           @rsubset(:x >= 0; view=true)
           @rtransform!(:sqrtx3 = sqrt(:x))
           parent
       end
9×4 DataFrame
 Row │ x        sqrtx           sqrtx2          sqrtx3
     │ Float64  Float64?        Float64?        Float64?
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │    -2.0  missing         missing         missing
   2 │    -1.5  missing         missing         missing
   3 │    -1.0  missing         missing         missing
   4 │    -0.5  missing         missing         missing
   5 │     0.0        0.0             0.0             0.0
   6 │     0.5        0.707107        0.707107        0.707107
   7 │     1.0        1.0             1.0             1.0
   8 │     1.5        1.22474         1.22474         1.22474
   9 │     2.0        1.41421         1.41421         1.41421
```
In the code above I used `parent` in the last step to recover the source `df`.

As a final comment note that an alternative in DataFramesMeta.jl is to just use a plain `@rtransform!` macro:

```
julia> @rtransform!(df, :sqrtx4 = :x < 0 ? missing : sqrt(:x))
9×5 DataFrame
 Row │ x        sqrtx           sqrtx2          sqrtx3          sqrtx4
     │ Float64  Float64?        Float64?        Float64?        Float64?
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │    -2.0  missing         missing         missing         missing
   2 │    -1.5  missing         missing         missing         missing
   3 │    -1.0  missing         missing         missing         missing
   4 │    -0.5  missing         missing         missing         missing
   5 │     0.0        0.0             0.0             0.0             0.0
   6 │     0.5        0.707107        0.707107        0.707107        0.707107
   7 │     1.0        1.0             1.0             1.0             1.0
   8 │     1.5        1.22474         1.22474         1.22474         1.22474
   9 │     2.0        1.41421         1.41421         1.41421         1.41421
```

In this case it also quite clean.

# Conclusions

I am really happy that we have a Korean version of Julia for Data Analysis.

I hope that the example transformations I have shown today were useful and improved your knowledge of DataFrames.jl and DataFramesMeta.jl packages.
