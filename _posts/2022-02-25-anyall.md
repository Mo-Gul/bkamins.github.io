# Introduction

Recently on Stack Overflow there was an [interesting question][so] about
row-wise aggregation of boolean columns in DataFrames.jl.

I think that the solution is an interesting exercise in functionalities of
DataFrames.jl.

The post was written under Julia 1.7 and DataFrames.jl 1.3.2.

# The question

Assume we have the following data frame:

```
julia> using DataFrames, Random

julia> Random.seed!(1234);

julia> df = DataFrame(rand(Bool, 10, 3), :auto)
10×3 DataFrame
 Row │ x1     x2     x3
     │ Bool   Bool   Bool
─────┼─────────────────────
   1 │  true  false   true
   2 │ false  false   true
   3 │ false  false  false
   4 │  true  false  false
   5 │  true   true  false
   6 │  true   true   true
   7 │  true  false   true
   8 │  true  false  false
   9 │ false  false  false
  10 │  true  false   true
```

We now would like to apply `all` and `any` functions to this data frame
row-wise. The basic approach to this task would be to do the following solution:

```
julia> transform(df, AsTable(r"x") .=> ByRow.([all, any]))
10×5 DataFrame
 Row │ x1     x2     x3     x1_x2_x3_all  x1_x2_x3_any
     │ Bool   Bool   Bool   Bool          Bool
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │  true  false   true         false          true
   2 │ false  false   true         false          true
   3 │ false  false  false         false         false
   4 │  true  false  false         false          true
   5 │  true   true  false         false          true
   6 │  true   true   true          true          true
   7 │  true  false   true         false          true
   8 │  true  false  false         false          true
   9 │ false  false  false         false         false
  10 │  true  false   true         false          true
```

The problem with this approach is that it does not scale well when you have
many columns in your data frame:

```
julia> df2 = DataFrame(rand(Bool, 10_000, 1000), :auto);

julia> @time select(df2, AsTable(r"x") .=> ByRow.([all, any]));
 12.026759 seconds (1.13 M allocations: 730.530 MiB, 0.39% gc time, 42.79% compilation time)

julia> @time select(df2, AsTable(r"x") .=> ByRow.([all, any]));
  6.746910 seconds (145.42 k allocations: 678.763 MiB, 0.29% gc time)
```

As you can see it has both high compilation cost and high execution time.

# Speeding up the computation

The basic way to resolve this issue is to use the composition with `collect`, as
the `DataFrames.table_transformation` documentation suggests us. In this way we
avoid constructing a very wide `NamedTuple`, which is problematic in this
case.

```
julia> @time select(df2, AsTable(r"x") .=> ByRow.([all, any] .∘ collect));
  0.616105 seconds (893.18 k allocations: 69.745 MiB, 3.26% gc time, 80.07% compilation time)

julia> @time select(df2, AsTable(r"x") .=> ByRow.([all, any] .∘ collect));
  0.129053 seconds (26.39 k allocations: 21.293 MiB, 6.65% gc time)
```

This is much better. However, we can further notice that `any` function is
essentially the same as `maximum`, and `all` the same as `minimum` for boolean
data. In this case we do not have to use the `collect` composition:

```
julia> @time select(df2, AsTable(r"x") .=> ByRow.([minimum, maximum]));
  0.393608 seconds (783.29 k allocations: 42.571 MiB, 2.45% gc time, 96.49% compilation time)

julia> @time select(df2, AsTable(r"x") .=> ByRow.([minimum, maximum]));
  0.002593 seconds (5.37 k allocations: 503.359 KiB)
```

This time things are very fast, as row-wise aggregation for `maximum`
and `minimum` is optimized.

# Conclusions

There are the following lessons from the examples we have given today:
* when performing row-wise aggregation the default `AsTable` timings can be bad,
  because they construct an intermediate `NamedTuple`, which is expensive
  (of course sometimes it is useful, if you want to refer to column names in
  transformations - that is why this form is supported);
* to avoid construction of `NamedTuple` use composition with `collect`, which
  uses a faster path that passes a vector to the aggregation function directly;
* an even faster option is available for selected list of most common aggregation
  functions, which includes: `sum`, `length`, `mean`, `var`, `std`, `median`,
  `minimum`, and `maximum` (all potentially composed with `skipmissing`).
