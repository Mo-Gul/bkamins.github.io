# Introduction

[JuliaCon 2021][juliacon] schedule looks awesome.
The breadth and depth of topics covered is really impressive and I am sure
everyone will find many interesting talks to attend.

There are so many valuable presentations that it is super cool that everything
is recorded as otherwise I would not be able to attend every session I would
like to learn from.

The conference is divided into two blocks.
From July 20 to July 27 we have two 3-hour workshops each day. I think this
is a super nice to have them. Then from July 28 to July 30 we have talks,
posters, and BoF/Mini Track sessions.

# DataFrames.jl during workshops

From the perspective of learning how to use
[DataFrames.jl][df] in your data science workflows I will give a
[DataFrames.jl 1.2 tutorial][tutorialdf] on Tuesday, July 20, 2021.
The workshop is live session.

All the material that I will use in the tutorial is available on [GitHub]
[ghtutorial]. If you want to follow my examples live I recommend you to download
it and read the prerequisite instructions before the workshop.

There are already many on-line materials that walk users though basic
functionality and syntax of [DataFrames.jl][df]. You can find the appropriate
links [here][dfmanual]. Therefore this year I have decided to prepare a tutorial
that shows how a simple data science project can be done end-to-end using
[DataFrames.jl][df] and other packages from the [JuliaData][jd] and
[JuliaStats][js] ecosystem.

I would also drive your attention to the
[Statistics with Julia from the ground up][stats] workshop that will be held
on Wednesday, July 21, 2021, where also [DataFrames.jl][df] will be featured.

# Presentations about DataFrames.jl

I will give two DataFrames.jl related presentations during the conference.

The first one is on Thursday, July 29, 2021 and is about
[Release management - lessons learned in JuliaData ecosystem][releasetalk].
In this presentation I discuss my experiences from serving as one of the
maintainers of [DataFrames.jl][df]. I hope that the talk will be useful both for
regular users as I discuss typical issues that people starting to use
DataFrames.jl face, and for package contributors since I share the package
maintenance practices we I have learned to be useful. This talk is pre-recorded.

The second talk on Friday, July 30, 2021 will present a summary about
[the state and plans for DataFrames.jl][dftalk]
package and is not pre-recorded.

# Conclusion

I am really excited about [JuliaCon 2021][juliacon] and cannot wait to
virtually meet you during the conference!
